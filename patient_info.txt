Hello, my name is Dr. Priya Nair. I am a 43-year-old female patient. I have a long history of type 2 diabetes, which I was diagnosed with 12 years ago. I also suffer from hypothyroidism and take levothyroxine daily. Over the past few months, I’ve been experiencing persistent fatigue, especially in the afternoons, along with occasional blurred vision and increased thirst. I’ve also had tingling in my feet, which my doctor suspects may be early neuropathy. My blood sugar levels have been fluctuating a lot, and I often feel dizzy if I skip a meal. Last year, I had a mild case of COVID-19 and recovered completely, but since then I’ve noticed more frequent headaches and sometimes trouble sleeping.

In addition, I have been dealing with anxiety for the last 6 years, for which I take occasional medication prescribed by my psychiatrist. I don’t smoke or drink alcohol, but I do have a sedentary lifestyle due to my desk job. Recently, I’ve also gained about 5-6 kilograms over the last 4 months. I have not had any surgeries in the past, but my mother had a history of heart disease and passed away due to a cardiac arrest at 59.

Currently, I take metformin, levothyroxine, and occasionally lorazepam. I try to walk every evening but have not been consistent. Over the last two weeks, I’ve also started noticing some pain in my lower back and stiffness in the mornings that improves as the day progresses. I’ve scheduled a consultation with an endocrinologist and a physiotherapist next week.

Please let me know if further details are needed.
